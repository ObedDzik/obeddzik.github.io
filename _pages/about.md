I read *A Tale of Two Cities* as a kid, and I've ever since seen its echoes in life's contrasts: chaos and order, tradition and transformation, stagnation and progress. In much the same way, my research sits at the intersection of human cognition and machine intelligence, not as opposing forces, but as a beautiful convergence, each enriching the other.

I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of British Columbia, advised by [Purang Abolmaesumi](https://ece.ubc.ca/purang-abolmaesumi/) and [Parvin Mousavi](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/parvin-mousavi/). I'm broadly interested in building intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and reason in complex environments, particularly in biomedical domains and multi-agent settings. My research focuses on developing algorithms that enhance machine perception, decision-making, and interpretability, with applications ranging from medical image analysis to agent-based system design. Specifically, I explore challenges at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human cognition, and biological systems, such as:

- **Biomedical AI & Medical Image Understanding**: How do we build machine learning systems that assist in biomedical reasoning, diagnosis, and discovery? How can we develop algorithms that not only perform accurate segmentation, classification, or prediction on medical imaging data, but also do so in ways that are interpretable, trustworthy, and aligned with human expertise? I study biomedical AI systems that merge data-driven performance with human-centered design, aiming to integrate domain knowledge and physician feedback into model development.

- **Agentic Systems & Multi-Agent Learning**: How can we design AI agents that act autonomously while still collaborating with others in dynamic environments? What principles of coordination, negotiation, and competition allow agentic systems to solve complex, real-world tasks? Can we build agents that reason over latent goals, communicate effectively, and align their strategies with human values and intentions? Iâ€™m particularly interested in multi-agent reinforcement learning as a framework for studying these questions, both for simulation-based research and real-world system design.

- **Interpretability, Reliability, and Human-in-the-Loop Design**: Can we build AI systems that communicate their reasoning in a way that's useful to humans? How do we quantify and visualize uncertainty, causal reasoning, and decision-making in a way that improves trust and transparency? I explore approaches that blend model interpretability with human-in-the-loop learning, aiming to make machine systems more aligned with human understanding, especially in safety-critical and clinical contexts.

I draw from biomedical and computer science and engineering, and concepts in cognitive science and human-computer interaction to explore how intelligent systems can learn, communicate, and adapt like natural agents. I am thankful for receiving the FYF Fellowship, the NSERC MUSIC Scholarship, the Vector Institute Research Grant and CIFAR Inclusive AI Scholarship, BPOC Graduate Excellence Award and the President's Academic Excellence Initiative PhD Award.

I hold a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from the University of British Columbia, where I conducted research at the [BC Cancer Research Institute](https://www.bccrc.ca) in the Department of Integrative Oncology, under the supervision of [Arman Rahmim](https://www.bccrc.ca/dept/io/people/arman-rahmim). I also spent time at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai), working with [Xiaoxiao Li](https://xxlya.github.io) on machine learning research in biomedical contexts. Outside of research, I enjoy watching documentaries of historical happenings and the stories of inventors and their creations.
