collection: publications
# permalink: /publication/neural_amortize_inference
excerpt: 'As an alternative to proprietary reconstruction software and low-level toolkits, we developed SlicerSPECTRecon, a 3D Slicer extension for open-source Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) image reconstruction. Designed to support reproducible research and collaborative development of new reconstruction algorithms, it provides a user-friendly interface and supports a range of widely used methods. The tool accepts raw projection data from clinical or Monte Carlo-simulated scanners and is built on the PyTomography Python library, featuring GPU-accelerated functionality for efficient, high-speed reconstruction.'
