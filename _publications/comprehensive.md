title: "Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantitative Measurements from Automated Deep Segmentations of PSMA PET/CT Images"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Does optimizing segmentation models for overlap metrics like Dice translate into clinically meaningful results? In this work, we investigated that question by evaluating four loss functions, including our proposed L1-Weighted Dice Focal Loss, on their ability to detect and segment tumors in whole-body PET/CT scans. Beyond traditional segmentation scores, we assessed each modelâ€™s performance on a set of clinically relevant quantitative measures using statistical evaluation metrics.'
