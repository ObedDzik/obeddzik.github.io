title: "Adaptive Voxel-Weighted Loss Using L1 Norms in Deep Neural Networks for Detection and Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Lesions in PET/CT Images"
collection: publications
excerpt: "How can we optimize neural network learning to detect and segment tumors in whole-body PET/CT images, while minimizing false positives and addressing inter- and intra-class imbalance? We proposed L1 Dice Focal Loss, a novel loss function that incorporates L1 norms to adaptively weight voxels based on their classification difficulty, helping the model focus on challenging regions during training."
